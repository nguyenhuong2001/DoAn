More carbon dioxide means more heat is trapped across the Earth, causing it to warm up. But scaled up over the entire planet, these physical processes interact in a myriad of complex and sometimes unexpected ways. The Arctic reflects sunlight back into space. Clouds in some circumstances trap heat, and in others, they cool the region beneath them. Forests store a big chunk of carbon, but they\u2019re being burned, cut down, and dying off from warming. The ocean soaks up a huge amount of heat and carbon dioxide, but it can\u2019t absorb it forever. And these effects are not all linear; some may taper off as the planet heats up while others may suddenly accelerate. That\u2019s why scientists for decades have struggled to answer the basic question of how much the earth will eventually warm up for a given amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

This year, due to the seemingly endless pandemic, Black Friday has become even more nebulous, with major retailers emphasizing online shopping and offering month-long sales to keep crowds at bay. And with good reason: A Deloitte survey found that more than half of shoppers polled are anxious about shopping in stores during the holiday season, not just on Black Friday but in the time leading up to the winter holidays as well. Another survey, by Accenture, found that 61 percent of respondents plan on limiting their in-store shopping time, to keep themselves and essential workers safe.Nothing says \u201csuperspreader event\u201d quite like a crowd of hundreds of people \u2014 many of whom just finished having a lengthy indoor meal with friends or relatives who may or may not have traveled across the country \u2014 gathered outside a store. A traditional Black Friday wouldn\u2019t just be dangerous for shoppers; it\u2019d also be dangerous for store employees, who already have to work long hours on the holiday.", "is_real": 0},

Photography became a leading industry in newly opened Japan, to satisfy a market of curious outsiders who wanted to know what the country and its people really looked like. Foreign photographers like Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried established photo studios, and they employed fine artists from the Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock print industry to carefully apply watercolors to their prints. Eventually, those same apprentices dominated the market with their own photo studios. By the 20th century, mainly due to the advent of amateur photography, the souvenir photo industry in Japan declined.
