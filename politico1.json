The so-called Facebook oversight board has been deliberating Trump\u2019s case since January, when he was booted off after the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol over fears he might incite more violence. Their decision could give the former president back one of his most powerful megaphones or muzzle him permanently on yet another major social media platform. While the board members have spoken sparingly about how they are weighing Trump\u2019s suspension, many have a long track record of weighing in on contentious issues around free speech on social media, and their backgrounds could offer a glimpse into how they each approached Trump\u2019s blockbuster case.

It was a major shift for a president who continues to reduce any debate about immigration to stoking fears about border defense and crime. But the Trump administration and Congress have done little to help keep farmworkers safe on the job.Six months into the pandemic, according to a POLITICO analysis, these workers appear to be victims of the worst of the Covid-19 crisis. For several weeks, many of the places that grow the nation\u2019s fruits and vegetables have seen disproportionately high rates of coronavirus cases \u2014 a national trend that, as harvest season advances in many states, threatens already vulnerable farmworkers, their communities and the places they work.", "is_fake": 0},

And the friction is creating an early test for the Democratic Party\u2019s commitment to following the advice of scientists when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic.Tensions began bubbling up this week as Chicago teachers and city officials clashed over a plan to reopen. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot insists that classrooms are safe, but teachers in the city are pushing for an expansion in vaccinations first. Now, a version of that fight is playing out nationally, as the White House tries to navigate between a growing body of science indicating that long-held fears of reopening schools may be overblown with demands from teachers for more funding and health supplies before returning to the classroom.Teachers\u2019 unions, which played a crucial role in Biden\u2019s electoral victory last fall, say they share the goal of reopening schools for in-person learning, but that this can only be done if schools have the resources to safely proceed. White House officials, too, said Biden\u2019s 100-day goal depends on Congress following through with more funding for schools to pay for improved ventilation, reduced class sizes and other Covid mitigation strategies.

From imposing a ban on Chinese-made drones to rolling back rules on sexual harassment, from cracking down on robocalls to letting states legalize marijuana, Trump changed some key areas of federal policy in ways that may have lasting impact well after he\u2019s gone. But here\u2019s the thing \u2014 between all the news coverage of the president himself, a global pandemic and various other upheavals, there\u2019s a good chance you missed a lot of them.

Princeton said it won\u2019t accept the $2.4 million that was headed its way.Yale University followed their lead with an announcement Wednesday night it would do the same. The University of Pennsylvania added to the list on Thursday, meaning the nation's five wealthiest private schools with the largest endowments have all decided to forgo their stimulus cash.Colleges and universities across the country are grappling with significant financial losses brought on by the coronavirus as they\u2019ve shut down their campuses and moved instruction online. Some schools have been pleading with Congress for more money in recent weeks, saying the stimulus law that provided nearly $14 billion for higher education is not enough to support their students and soften the economic blow they\u2019re seeing from losses in revenue.", "is_fake": 0},

Others are thinking about going part-time, or taking a gap year so they can work and bail out families whose breadwinners are suddenly out of work. Those who work with low-income students worry freshmen from poor families who were sent home this semester may never return and high school seniors won't get the hands-on help they need with their financial aid applications.The effects of these decisions could ripple across not just campuses but the U.S. for years to come. Students could be stuck in lower-paying jobs for the rest of their lives, lacking the financial boost brought by a four-year college degree. Requests for additional financial aid will ramp up, and colleges with their own financial struggles may not be able to meet the demand. Colleges could see the widening of an already existing gap between low- and high-income students entering their doors, and many are trying to make it easier for applicants whose lives are in chaos.", "is_fake": 0},

And there was little doubt that, given the breadth of the law and the many suspected violations by global tech firms, there would soon be heavy fines or, at least, sanctions that would force Big Tech to change its operating methods.But that promise has not been fulfilled. Aside from a \u20ac50 million fine that France's privacy regulator imposed on Google in January, there have been no fines or remedies levied at a U.S. giant since the GDPR came into effect. And the two nations most directly responsible for policing the tech sector \u2014 Ireland and Luxembourg, where the largest tech firms have their European headquarters \u2014 have yet to wrap up a single investigation of any magnitude concerning a U.S. firm.", "is_fake": 0},

But efforts to check its spread are hitting a wall of resistance on both sides of the Atlantic.One big reason: Western governments are embracing this technology for their own use, valuing security and data collection over privacy and civil liberties. And in Washington, President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment and the death of a key civil rights and privacy champion have snarled expectations for a congressional drive to enact restrictions.The result is an impasse that has left tech companies largely in control of where and how to deploy facial recognition, which they have sold to police agencies and embedded in consumers\u2019 apps and smartphones. The stalemate has persisted even in Europe\u2019s most privacy-minded countries, such as Germany, and despite a bipartisan U.S. alliance of civil-libertarian Democrats and Republicans.", "is_fake": 0},

The process is meant to limit the spread of a potential outbreak while minimizing the costs of the frequent large-scale testing needed to keep the disease in check. Pooled testing can extend testing capacity by testing groups of samples at once rather than each person individually. If a pool sample comes back positive, each individual in the pool is then tested.Massachusetts is the only state to deploy a broad pooled testing program made available to all of its students and staff \u2014 about 1 million K-12 children and educators \u2014 to reopen this spring. For the first six weeks, the Bay State expects to spend somewhere between $15 million and $30 million doing pooled testing for about half of its more than 1,800 public schools that have opted in.

It was hosted by the U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance, a group made up of the heavyweights in American agriculture. It brought together three secretaries of agriculture, including the current one, Sonny Perdue, among an A-list of about 100 leaders that included the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation \u2014 a longtime, powerful foe of federal action on climate \u2014 and CEOs of major food companies, green groups and anti-hunger advocates.Even a year ago, such a meeting would have been improbable, if not impossible. But the long-held resistance to talking about climate change among largely conservative farmers and ranchers and the lobbying behemoths that represent them is starting to shift. The veil of secrecy attested to just how sensitive the topic remains, but over the course of the two-day gathering, the group coalesced around big ideas like the need to pay farmers to use their land to draw down carbon from the atmosphere, participants told POLITICO.", "is_fake": 0},

Researchers there were studying dangerous bat coronaviruses, and safety procedures at the facility were not as rigorous as they should have been. The Chinese government then covered up the incident, blaming a seafood market near the lab for launching the pandemic and refusing to allow any independent investigation.Variations on this theory, once promoted by only a handful of anti-China hardliners, are now being flogged relentlessly every night on Fox News, the president\u2019s preferred primetime viewing.
